# UV_Carotenoid_Induction

Here we have determined UV-B induced accumulation of carotenoid in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) and asked

1. Whether induction relies on UV-B application duration (Kinetic study). 
  The data and code of kinetic study is labelled as KCarCar $ KSCarChl and Kinetic study_R, respectively

2.Iif UV (UVR8) or blue light (phototropins or cryptochrome) photoreceptors mediate accumulation of carotenoid (photomutant study). 
    The data and code of photomutant study is labelled as PMSCarCar $ PMSCarChl and Photomutantstudy_Car_R, respectively

3. Whether Carotenoids contributes to UV-B photoprotection through looking at various genotypes inpaired in carotenoid biosynthesis. 
The data for:
    CMSstudy for carotenoids, chl and chl a fluorescence are labelled CMSdata and CMS-Carotenoid_R(code) 

Lastly, the data labelles Copy of UV intensities new setting 190121 shows the UV and PAR spectra and intensity measurement.
