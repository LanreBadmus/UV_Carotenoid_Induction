# UV_Carotenoid_Induction

Here we have determined UV-B induced accumulation of carotenoid in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) and asked

1. Whether induction relies on UV-B application duration (Kinetic study). 
  The data and code of kinetic study is labelled as CarKS and Kinetic study_R respectively

2.Iif UV (UVR8) or blue light (phototropins or cryptochrome) photoreceptors mediate accumulation of carotenoid (photomutant study). 
    The data and code of photomutant study is labelled as PMSCar and Photomutantstudy_R respectively

3. Whether Carotenoids contributes to UV-B photoprotection through looking at various genotypes inpaired in carotenoid biosynthesis. 
The data for:
    CMSstudy for carotenoids are labelled CMSCar (data) and CMS-Carotenoid_R(code) 
    CMS study for chl a fluorescence are labelled CMSChlFlu (data) and CMS-chlflu_R(code) 
    CMS study for tocopherols are labelled VteToc (data) and VTE-toc_R(code)

Lastly, the data labelles Copy of UV intensities new setting 190121 shows the UV and PAR spectra and intensity measurement.
